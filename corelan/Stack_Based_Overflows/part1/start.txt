WinDbg Setup		: Your going to need to install the Virtual CD-ROM Control Panel as shown
                          in the above link. Once the contents of the zipfile have been extracted
                          go ahead and copy VCdRom.sys into C:\WINDOWS\system32\drivers. Then go
                          ahead and launch VCdControlTool.exe. Click [Driver Control] -> [Install 
                          Driver] -> "Select the file we moved {VCdRom.sys}" -> [Start] -> [OK].
			  With that done go ahead and click [Add Drive] -> [Mount] -> [.ISO IMG]
                          -> [OK] -> [OK]. With our ISO mounted go ahead and go to the drive letter
                          added and double click to launch the setup. I went ahead and installed
                          everything but you just need the debugging tools. Once complete you will
                          need to "cd" into the directory with windbg and run "windbg -i" example:
			
			  C:\WinDDK\7600.16385.1\Debuggers> windbg.exe -I
			
			  If everything went well you should recieve "WindDbg was successfully ~".
                          In order to avoid WinDbg complaining about Symbol files not found, create
                          a folder in C:\ called "windbgsymbols". Then In WinDbg go to [File] -> 
			  [Symbol File Path] -> paste the below:
			
			  SRV*C:\windbgsymbols*http://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols
			
			  Close and save. Windbg should now be good to go!

Immunity Debugger	: Not gonna go into this since its like any exe

What is an .rc file?	: Just a resource file used with the metasploit framework to automate usage, 
                          down below is a usage example:


	                          hax0r@wetw0rk:~/sudo msfconsole -r rm-mp3.rc
	                          ---snip---
	                          [*] Started reverse TCP handler on X:X 
	                          [*] Starting the payload handler...
	                          [*] Encoded stage with x86/shikata_ga_nai
	                          [*] Sending encoded stage (267 bytes) to X
	
	                          Microsoft Windows XP [Version 5.1.2600]

	                          C:\Program Files\Easy RM to MP3 Converter>

			  I will be using these on most if not all the examples.
